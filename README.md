# Snippets

Museum of (mostly) useless crap I've hacked together over the years.

**This repository is online for archival reasons only.**  
* If you came here looking for polyfills, they've been given a [dedicated repository][1].
Copies of them are only kept here to fight bit-rot for those following old links from Stack Overflow or MDN.

* [`js/utils.js`][2] is the only other thing likely to be useful to somebody.
It'll probably be moved to a dedicated repository some day.

Take whatever you want from here; but don't expect all of it to be useful.

No future updates will be made here.
