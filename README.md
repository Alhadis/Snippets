Snippets
========

A stash of helper functions, boilerplate code, and useful snippets I've written during projects. Chiefly intended for personal use, but you're more than welcome to take whatever you need. =)


Rundown
-------

As a general rule of thumb, files that're designed to be freshly dropped into an existing project folder will have a web-friendly, lowercase filename written in "kebab-case-like-this". Files with less orthodox use (such as those designed to be taken apart or embedded into existing code) will generally have a human-friendly filename. This isn't a convention I adhere to very strongly, however, but hopefully you get the gist.
